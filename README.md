NAME - Kalind Joshi

I will be creating a database which will have fields like product ID, Name, Price, Discount, Quantity, total, Cashier ID, Date and time and barcode.
A barcode will be created and linked to each product which will show details like Prod ID, Name, Price, Discount on being scanned.
Finally, I will try creating a invoice which will have all the details of the product when a barcode is scanned or a product ID is used and the total is displayed on the bill
Currently, I am working on this project on my own.
